# 🛡️ Deceptra AI  
### Multimodal Social Media Deception Detection System

Deceptra AI is an advanced multimodal system designed to detect deception, misinformation, and deepfake signals across social media content using AI-powered text and image analysis.

It combines NLP, computer vision, and fusion scoring to generate an explainable deception risk score.

# 🧠 How It Works

1. User uploads text and/or image
2. Text model analyzes linguistic deception patterns
3. Image model detects fake/manipulated content
4. Fusion engine combines both signals
5. System outputs deception risk score with explanation
